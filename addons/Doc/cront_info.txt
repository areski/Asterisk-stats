- To setup scheduler there some defines you have to set in defines.php :

 // this is the default name of table , if you change also change in cdr_mysql_table.sql 
 define ("SCHEDULER_TABLENAME","scheduler"); 
 
 // Log file file , set the rights to allow create and write it.
 define ("SCHEDULER_LOGFILE","/var/log/scheduler/scheduler.log");

 // Path and prefix to generate the pdfs reports
 // So /tmp/scheduler-1.pdf /tmp/scheduler-20.pdf will generate
 // where the number is the id of scheduler in database table.
 define ("SCHEDULER_PDF_PATH","/tmp/scheduler");
 

 *  MAIL *
 
 The mail uses PEAR , so you need to install php-pear and some pear packages :

 * Mail
 * Mail_Mime

 pear install Mail Mail_Mime

 you need to setup the include path of pear in php.ini

 - In Debian (/etc/php4/cli/php.ini) :
 - In Fedora/Redhat (/etc/php.ini) :
 
 include_path = ".:/usr/share/php"

 * some defines in defines.php

 define ("SCHEDULER_MAIL_FROM","root@localhost");

 * CRONTAB *

 Finally add a new line to crontab to run every hour :

 crontab -e ( you can set as root so you won't have problems with SCHEDULER_LOGFILE ).

 5 * * * *  /path_to_scheduler_directory/scheduler.php

 ( 5 * * * *  /var/www/html/radius-stat/asterisk-stat/crontjob/scheduler.php )

 * NOTE *

 - Be sure that scheduler.php and export_pdf_scheduler.php can be executed by
 the owner of crontab task.

 chmod +x export_pdf_scheduler.php scheduler.php
 
 - Check that the owner of crontab task has rights to write SCHEDULER_LOGFILE file.

 - Check that the owner of crontab task has rights to write on SCHEDULER_PDF_PATH

 - Check that php ( from cgi or cli ) is on /usr/bin/php
